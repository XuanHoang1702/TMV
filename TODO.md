# Contact Page Map Implementation

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Steps:
- [x] Analyzed contact page structure and Information model
- [x] Studied edit information page map implementation
- [x] Created implementation plan
- [x] Add Leaflet JS script to contact page
- [x] Add map initialization JavaScript
- [x] **FIXED: CSS conflicts with site.css global img styles**
- [x] **FIXED: Added CSS overrides for Leaflet map tiles**
- [x] **FIXED: Null safety for Information model**
- [x] Test map display functionality
- [x] Verify fallback image functionality

### Issues Found & Fixed:
1. **CSS Conflict**: Global `img { max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; }` rule in site.css was interfering with Leaflet map tiles
2. **Null Safety**: JavaScript was failing when Information model was null
3. **Missing CSS**: Map container styles were duplicated in JavaScript instead of CSS

### Solutions Implemented:
1. **Added CSS overrides** in @section('styles') to fix Leaflet tile display
2. **Fixed JavaScript null safety** for Information model properties
3. **Moved map styles** to CSS section for better organization
4. **Added comprehensive error handling** and loading states

## Implementation Summary:
✅ Successfully added map functionality to contact page:
- Added Leaflet JS script inclusion with proper loading
- Added comprehensive map initialization JavaScript with null safety
- Used saved coordinates from Information model with fallbacks
- Added custom marker with popup showing address and "Get Directions" button
- Added loading states and error handling
- Added responsive CSS styling
- Added fallback image functionality
- **FIXED CSS conflicts** that prevented map from displaying

## Key Fixes Applied:
1. **CSS Override**: `.leaflet-container img { max-width: none !important; max-height: none !important; }`
2. **Null Safety**: `{{ $information && $information->latitude ? $information->latitude : 21.0285 }}`
3. **Proper Styling**: Moved all map-related CSS to @section('styles')

The map should now display correctly on the frontend contact page, just like it does in the admin area!
